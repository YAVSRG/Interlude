# **YAVSRG :: Interlude**
The YET ANOTHER VERTICALLY SCROLLING RHYTHM GAME project is a collection of all my ideas on what could be done with VSRGs, brought to life.

This is my custom-made VSRG client, with the aim to put lots of tools, charts and quality of life into one place.

Click [here to read more info about this project](https://www.yavsrg.net/)

## 🎮 Play it:

Go [here](https://github.com/YAVSRG/Interlude/releases) for pre-built versions (download and extract the zip, run the exe)

## 🤝 Contributing

Come join [the discord](https://discord.gg/tA22tWR) -- I need YOUR help particularly with playtesting upcoming tables features

## 🤖 Building it yourself

You shouldn't need to do this. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/YAVSRG/Interlude/releases) instead

Want to run it on Linux or MacOS just for a laugh? Use [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable) for the time being

I have proven cross platform builds as a concept, but will only bother to add them to the releases system if I have the time and reason to do it
