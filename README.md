# **YAVSRG :: Interlude**
The YET ANOTHER VERTICALLY SCROLLING RHYTHM GAME project is a collection of all my ideas on what could be done with VSRGs, brought to life.

This is my custom-made VSRG client, with the aim to put lots of tools, charts and quality of life into one place.

Click [here to read more info about this project](https://www.yavsrg.net/)

## üéÆ Play it:

Go [here](https://github.com/YAVSRG/Interlude/releases) for pre-built versions for Windows (download and extract the zip, run the exe)

## ü§ù Contributing

Come join [the discord](https://discord.gg/tA22tWR) -- Send me playtesting feedback, feature requests, bug reports, you name it

Pull requests are very welcome; If you want to work on a feature please check with me first via Discord

## ü§ñ Building it yourself

If you just want to play, you don't need to do this. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/YAVSRG/Interlude/releases) instead

If you are a developer and DO want to build and make changes, clone [this repo](https://github.com/YAVSRG/YAVSRG) and follow the README instructions there to set up the development polyrepo.

Want to play on macOS/Linux? Use [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable) for the time being.  
The game builds for macOS and Linux (some glitches on macOS), but they will only be added to the official release system if I have the resources and enough players requesting it (most people use Windows)
