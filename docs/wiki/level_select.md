# Level select

The level select screen is where you'll be spending a lot of time.  

Here is where you can sort, group and search through your chart library.

Every feature available to you has an ingame tooltip or explainer, so this page serves mostly as a quick overview of what's here, with a bit of attention drawn to features you may not have noticed.  
Everything also has a hotkey for quick access - Hotkeys are shown in the tooltips too!

Left-click and drag to scroll through songs, right-click and drag to fast-scroll.

Top secret tips for keyboard navigation:  

- `PageDown`, `PageUp`, `Home` and `End` let you navigate by entire groups at once
- `.` opens the right-click menu for the selected chart

## Scoreboard

The scoreboard on the left side of the screen shows your previous scores on the selected song.  
If you have an online account, you can also swap this for an online leaderboard for the selected song, if available.

Scores can be right-clicked on to open up a menu - One of the options is to **challenge this score** via the Pacemaker feature!

Secret tip: You can press `Z` to enable keyboard navigation of the scores list, and `.` to open the menu for scores

## Preview

Press the preview button (default hotkey `A`) to open a live preview of the chart before you play it.  
Handy for inspecting a chart before playing it in full.

## Mods & Pacemaker

Mods (short for modifiers) are settings that change a chart in some way, for example by mirroring the chart horizontally to get around mindblocks.  
They may serve as useful tools for practice, or ways to see charts you're used to in a different light.

The mod menu is also where you can set a **pacemaker**, or enable the **Autoplay** setting that lets you spectate a perfect playthrough of a chart.

Got an idea for a modifier? Suggest it in the Discord!

## Comments

Comments let you make notes or tag charts, for example "play this again", "this is good" or anything else you want to note to yourself.  

Charts with comments will show an icon next to them.  
You can write a comment on the current chart by pressing `F`, and `Shift+F` toggles an overlay displaying all comments.

You can search for keywords in comments by typing `comment="keywords here"` or `c="keywords here"` in the search box.

## Random chart suggestions

Hitting the 'random chart' button (hotkey `R`) will select a random chart from the visible charts.

There is an **under-construction feature** you can turn on under Advanced settings in the Options menu - When enabled the random chart is not so random.  
Instead an algorithm will try to find similar charts (by patterns, length, difficulty, etc) and switch to one of those.

A future feature plan is to greatly improve on this algorithm, and introduce an **endless mode**, where right after finishing a song, you get a couple of suggestions and immediately go into one of those instead of the full level select process.

## Collections

You can cycle the library view between 3 modes:  

- All charts
- Collections
- Current table

Collections function similarly to osu! collections, where you can create a custom set of charts.
A wiki article dedicated to them coming soon.
