0.7.15.1
====

Feature update 2 of a few in a short span of time!

# Bug fixes
- Fixed a bug when seeking to before the start of audio files in replay and practice mode
- Fixed a minor graphical glitch in score screen graph (hangover from 0.7.15's changes)
- Fixed some errors in chart loading under rare conditions
- Fixed scoreboard and leaderboard not updating until a chart fully and successfully loads
- Fixed visual offset not being factored into input overlay on replay mode

# New replay mode features
- You can pause replays (with space)
- You can speed up and slow down replays to get a better look (with the normal rate changing keybinds)
- New hit overlay in replay mode that highlights what judgements and ms deviations every input was awarded
  Particularly useful for reading off release timings even on weird skins
- Playfield dimming effect is now an adjustable slider so you can get the right contrast for the overlay over your notes
