Too good to be true¬Can't take my eyes off of you
Thank you for playing this game
Could this be a new record?
You have exercised utmost discernment, far beyond that of the layman
every place I would go, if I could fly
Some things old, some things new, some things borrowed, some things blue
Faster than a beam of light
Come on in, the water's fine
AND NOW YOU DO WHAT THEY TOLD YA
Still here, Still this
It's not like what they tell you
Variety is the vice of life
An idea shared is an idea halved
Let's give them something to talk about
You couldn't follow suit with a GPS
between the devil and the digital sea
You got the drip, I'm the whole lake
I guess I should take it as a sign
You think I'm joking? Well then, you don't know me
You choose you lose
Put your hands up
You choose, you lose
the continuation of the dream you forgot about yesterday
my most insane osu reaction ever (VOLUME WARNING!!!!)
This is going straight into my gamin playlist!!!
