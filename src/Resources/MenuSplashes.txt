Too good to be true¬Can't take my eyes off of you
Thank you for playing this game
Could this be a new record?
You have exercised utmost discernment, far beyond that of the layman
every place I would go, if I could fly
Some things old, some things new, some things borrowed, some things blue
Faster than a beam of light
Come on in, the water's fine
AND NOW YOU DO WHAT THEY TOLD YA
Still here, Still this
It's not like what they tell you
Variety is the vice of life
An idea shared is an idea halved
Let's give them something to talk about
You couldn't follow suit with a GPS
between the devil and the digital sea
You got the drip, I'm the whole lake
I guess I should take it as a sign
You think I'm joking? Well then, you don't know me
Put your hands up
You choose, you lose
the continuation of the dream you forgot about yesterday

Pignorance is bliss
CLOUDY WITH INTERMITTENT RAIN
Relax, we're all gonna make it
it's all been leading to this
It is natural to die
Up in the sky, When I look below
No punches left to roll with
hear me blingo on my guitarra
NOW CHECK THIS OUT
GIVE ME STUFF TO BREAK
It's gon' be one hell of a year
green, black and blue make the colors in the sky
Welcome to the jungle
Thanks for the memories
Give me a sign
how did we get here?
In a few moments, you will have an experience that will seem completely real
Sorry, I stuttered
Help me step mania, i'm STUCK
So far away, we wait for the day
to a place i've never seen
Talk to me baby
You gotta use your eyes to perceive the way
Just here to hold your hand when you die
Say it with your chest
Wasted off my own supply
Now is better than never
Always the best in town
From you, from me
wee woo, wee woo! congratulations!!¬you have come across a Rav easter egg!
